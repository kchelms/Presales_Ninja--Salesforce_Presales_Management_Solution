# The Product
Clientâ€™s problem is there exists no standardized way to manage their pre-sales workforce which has resulted in complete inconsistency in both the management and measurement of the success of those conducting pre-sales operations.

It will provide means for all necessary user roles across teams to request, schedule, and track pre-sales operations, as well as provide metrics for pre-sales team success based on data gathered through use of the product.

# Development Environment Setup
We ended up using VScode for our developement IDE. We then used python and it's pip to install all our packages to build the backend. For the frontend we used the Salesforce Extension Pack (Expanded) VScode extension.

# Downloadable Link
For the download we used the git clone command for the repository.<br />
Which is here:
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/mvandoren2/Senior_Project.git
```
